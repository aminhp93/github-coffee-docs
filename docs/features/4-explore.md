goals:
  - Passive (tech news): Idea is a quick look at news (like dailydev), to know, be interested in, vote.
  - Weekly news for React devs. For now, using the manually curated newsletter at [This Week in React](https://thisweekinreact.com/newsletter/221).
  - Active: Explore new knowledge with YouTube videos (dev, stock, real estate, etc.), tech news evaluation, and ChatGPT conversations. For now, using ClickUp for simple setup.
