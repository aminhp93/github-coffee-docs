## Table

First version of table is written based on vanilla js.

Second version is updated with data-grid MUI but not based from 1 component to inherit the feature. Customization and update is hard.

Third version is considered using headless UI (tanstack table) or keep using library (considering AG Grid) but with more structured and reusable component.
