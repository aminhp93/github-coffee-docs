## Chart

Which library have I used? echarts, highcharts
What is the difference and why I have to switch from echarts to highcharts?

Basic feature in both chart is seem the same. What feature I have face more frequently and spent more time on it?

- Multiple yaxis (case delete due to different type of unit)
- Zoom in/out with updated api data
- Manage/store the chart instance (how to update the option correctly)
- Customization (tooltip, legend, axis, etc)
- Sync chart
